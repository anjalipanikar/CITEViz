# CITE-Viz

Classifying cell clusters in single-cell sequencing data is often essential to investigate cell population heterogeneity, construct differential gene expression schemes, and facilitate downstream data interpretation. Here we developed CITE-Viz to classify heterogeneous cell populations in CITE-Seq (cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes) data by replicating a familiar and intuitive flow cytometry gating workflow using protein surface marker signal / using the R shiny platform.
